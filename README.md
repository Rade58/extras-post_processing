# Extra Workshops: Post Processing

We will be dealing with:

• Depth of field
• Bloom
• God ray
• Motion blur
• Glitch effect
• Outlines
• Color variations
• Antialiasing
• Reflections and refractions
• Etc.

## Setup

To some extent from this repo

<https://github.com/Rade58/advanced_threejs_realistic_render>

but I loaded different model

I divided old gi stuff into folder "realisticRender"

And when you want to add new things to gui, related to post processing, and it into "postProcessing" folder
